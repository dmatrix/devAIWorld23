    "\n",
    "In Ray, tasks and actors create and compute on objects. We refer to these objects as remote objects because they can be stored anywhere in a Ray cluster, and we use object refs to refer to them. Remote objects are cached in Ray’s distributed shared-memory object store, and there is one object store per node in the cluster. In the cluster setting, a remote object can live on one or many nodes, independent of who holds the object ref(s). Collectively, these individual object store makes a shared object store across the the Ray Cluster, as shown in the diagram below.\n",

    "|Ray archictecture with Ray nodes, each with its own object store. Collectively, it's a shared object store across the cluster.|\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects are immutable and can be accessed from anywhere on the cluster, as they are stored in the cluster shared memory. An object ref is essentially a pointer or a unique ID that can be used to refer to a remote object without seeing its value. If you’re familiar with futures in Python, Java or Scala, Ray object refs are conceptually similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, small objects are stored in their owner’s **in-process store** (**<=100KB**), while large objects are stored in the **distributed object store**. This decision is meant to reduce the memory footprint and resolution time for each object. Note that in the latter case, a placeholder object is stored in the in-process store to indicate the object has been promoted to shared memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case if there is no space in the shared-memory, objects are spilled over to disk. But the main point here is that\n",
    "shared-memory allows _zero-copy_ access to processes on the same worker node.\n",
